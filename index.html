          I bought my INNOGEAR Humidifer off of Amazon for 20 dollars and it was hands down my best COVID purchase (especially n comparison to the 100 dollar ones those stores in Fishtown sell). The package came with an LED light, a remote control and a set of essential oils to add to the water before turning the thing on. I like mixing the eucalyptus and lavender together. I once told a friend that it makes me feel less lonely, which saying it out loud felt very lame. But hey, it lights up and can change color.
